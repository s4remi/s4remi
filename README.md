            <li>🌱 I am currently a student in the Khoury College of Computer Science at
      Northeastern University, San Francisco campus. I am hoping to graduate in
      2024. Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng in civil Engineering and AS in
      Mathematics. I am highly interested in most areas of computer science,
      with a particular interest in computer graphics such ase <em><strong>AR,VR, Visualization and Computer Vision.</strong></em><br/></li>
            <li>I hope to maintain my passion for computer graphics and pursue relevant
      job opportunities in the future. In addition to computer graphics, I am
