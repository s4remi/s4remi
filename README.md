ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @s4remi<br>
ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a CS grad student in Northeastern University
ğŸŒ± I am currently a student in the Khoury College of Computer Science at
      Northeastern University, San Francisco campus. I am hoping to graduate in
      2024. Prior to this, I earned my B.Eng in civil Engineering and AS in
      Mathematics. I am highly interested in most areas of computer science,
      with a particular interest in computer graphics such ase
      AR,VR, Visualization and Computer Vision. I hope to maintain my passion for computer graphics and pursue relevant
      job opportunities in the future. In addition to computer graphics, I am
      also interested in backend development technologies such as distributed
      systems and networking.
